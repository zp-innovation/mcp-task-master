# Task ID: 43
# Title: Add Research Flag to Add-Task Command
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a '--research' flag for the add-task command that enables users to automatically generate research-related subtasks when creating a new task.
# Details:
Modify the add-task command to accept a new optional flag '--research'. When this flag is provided, the system should automatically generate and attach a set of research-oriented subtasks to the newly created task. These subtasks should follow a standard research methodology structure:

1. Background Investigation: Research existing solutions and approaches
2. Requirements Analysis: Define specific requirements and constraints
3. Technology/Tool Evaluation: Compare potential technologies or tools for implementation
4. Proof of Concept: Create a minimal implementation to validate approach
5. Documentation: Document findings and recommendations

The implementation should:
- Update the command-line argument parser to recognize the new flag
- Create a dedicated function to generate the research subtasks with appropriate descriptions
- Ensure subtasks are properly linked to the parent task
- Update help documentation to explain the new flag
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing add-task functionality

The research subtasks should be customized based on the main task's title and description when possible, rather than using generic templates.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the functionality and usability of the new feature:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test that the '--research' flag is properly parsed
   - Verify the correct number and structure of subtasks are generated
   - Ensure subtask IDs are correctly assigned and linked to the parent task

2. Integration tests:
   - Create a task with the research flag and verify all subtasks appear in the task list
   - Test that the research flag works with other existing flags (e.g., --priority, --depends-on)
   - Verify the task and subtasks are properly saved to the storage backend

3. Manual testing:
   - Run 'taskmaster add-task "Test task" --research' and verify the output
   - Check that the help documentation correctly describes the new flag
   - Verify the research subtasks have meaningful descriptions
   - Test the command with and without the flag to ensure backward compatibility

4. Edge cases:
   - Test with very short or very long task descriptions
   - Verify behavior when maximum task/subtask limits are reached
