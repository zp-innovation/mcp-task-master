Create comprehensive tests for tool registration and resource access\n\n<info added on 2025-03-31T18:35:21.513Z>\nHere is additional information to enhance the subtask regarding resources and resource templates in FastMCP:\n\nResources in FastMCP are used to expose static or dynamic data to LLM clients. For the Task Master MCP server, we should implement resources to provide:\n\n1. Task templates: Predefined task structures that can be used as starting points\n2. Workflow definitions: Reusable workflow patterns for common task sequences\n3. User preferences: Stored user settings for task management\n4. Project metadata: Information about active projects and their attributes\n\nResource implementation should follow this structure:\n\n```python\n@mcp.resource(\"tasks://templates/{template_id}\")\ndef get_task_template(template_id: str) -> dict:\n    # Fetch and return the specified task template\n    ...\n\n@mcp.resource(\"workflows://definitions/{workflow_id}\")\ndef get_workflow_definition(workflow_id: str) -> dict:\n    # Fetch and return the specified workflow definition\n    ...\n\n@mcp.resource(\"users://{user_id}/preferences\")\ndef get_user_preferences(user_id: str) -> dict:\n    # Fetch and return user preferences\n    ...\n\n@mcp.resource(\"projects://metadata\")\ndef get_project_metadata() -> List[dict]:\n    # Fetch and return metadata for all active projects\n    ...\n```\n\nResource templates in FastMCP allow for dynamic generation of resources based on patterns. For Task Master, we can implement:\n\n1. Dynamic task creation templates\n2. Customizable workflow templates\n3. User-specific resource views\n\nExample implementation:\n\n```python\n@mcp.resource(\"tasks://create/{task_type}\")\ndef get_task_creation_template(task_type: str) -> dict:\n    # Generate and return a task creation template based on task_type\n    ...\n\n@mcp.resource(\"workflows://custom/{user_id}/{workflow_name}\")\ndef get_custom_workflow_template(user_id: str, workflow_name: str) -> dict:\n    # Generate and return a custom workflow template for the user\n    ...\n\n@mcp.resource(\"users://{user_id}/dashboard\")\ndef get_user_dashboard(user_id: str) -> dict:\n    # Generate and return a personalized dashboard view for the user\n    ...\n```\n\nBest practices for integrating resources with Task Master functionality:\n\n1. Use resources to provide context and data for tools\n2. Implement caching for frequently accessed resources\n3. Ensure proper error handling and not-found cases for all resources\n4. Use resource templates to generate dynamic, personalized views of data\n5. Implement access control to ensure users only access authorized resources\n\nBy properly implementing these resources and resource templates, we can provide rich, contextual data to LLM clients, enhancing the Task Master's capabilities and user experience.\n</info added on 2025-03-31T18:35:21.513Z>",

Use `path.join()` and `path.resolve()` for cross-platform path handling\n2. Avoid hardcoded forward/backslashes in paths\n3. Use `os.homedir()` for user home directory references\n\n### Best Practices for Path Resolution\n\n1. **Absolute vs Relative Paths**:\n   - Always convert relative paths to absolute using `path.resolve()`\n   - Use `path.isAbsolute()` to check if a path is already absolute\n\n2. **Handling Different Installation Scenarios**:\n   - Local dev: Use `process.cwd()` as fallback project root\n   - Local dependency: Resolve paths relative to consuming project\n   - Global install: Use `process.execPath` to locate global `node_modules`\n\n3. **Configuration Options**:\n   - Allow users to specify custom project root via CLI option or config file\n   - Implement a clear precedence order for path resolution (e.g., CLI option > config file > auto-detection)\n\n4. **Error Handling**:\n   - Provide clear error messages when critical paths cannot be resolved\n   - Implement retry logic with alternative methods if primary path detection fails\n\n5. **Documentation**:\n   - Clearly document path handling behavior in README and inline comments\n   - Provide examples for common scenarios and edge cases\n\nBy implementing these practices, the MCP tools can achieve consistent and robust path handling across various npm installation and usage scenarios.\n</info added on 2025-04-01T02:21:57.137Z>\n\n<info added on 2025-04-01T02:25:01.463Z>\nHere's additional information addressing the request for clarification on path handling challenges for npm packages:\n\n## Advanced Path Handling Challenges and Solutions\n\n### Challenges to Avoid\n\n1. **Relying solely on process.cwd()**:\n   - Global installs: process.cwd() could be any directory\n   - Local installs as dependency: points to parent project's root\n   - Users may run commands from subdirectories\n\n2. **Dual Path Requirements**:\n   - Package Path: Where task-master code is installed\n   - Project Path: Where user's tasks.json resides\n\n3. **Specific Edge Cases**:\n   - Non-project directory execution\n   - Deeply nested project structures\n   - Yarn/pnpm workspaces\n   - Monorepos with multiple tasks.json files\n   - Commands invoked from scripts in different directories\n\n### Advanced Solutions\n\n1. **Project Marker Detection**:\n   - Implement recursive search for package.json or .git\n   - Use `find-up` package for efficient directory traversal\n   ```javascript\n   const findUp = require('find-up');\n   const projectRoot = await findUp(dir => findUp.sync('package.json', { cwd: dir }));\n   ```\n\n2. **Package Path Resolution**:\n   - Leverage `import.meta.url` with `fileURLToPath`:\n   ```javascript\n   import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';\n   import path from 'path';\n   \n   const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);\n   const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);\n   const packageRoot = path.resolve(__dirname, '..');\n   ```\n\n3. **Workspace-Aware Resolution**:\n   - Detect Yarn/pnpm workspaces:\n   ```javascript\n   const findWorkspaceRoot = require('find-yarn-workspace-root');\n   const workspaceRoot = findWorkspaceRoot(process.cwd());\n   ```\n\n4. **Monorepo Handling**:\n   - Implement cascading configuration search\n   - Allow multiple tasks.json files with clear precedence rules\n\n5. **CLI Tool Inspiration**:\n   - ESLint: Uses `eslint-find-rule-files` for config discovery\n   - Jest: Implements `jest-resolve` for custom module resolution\n   - Next.js: Uses `find-up` to locate project directories\n\n6. **Robust Path Resolution Algorithm**:\n   ```javascript\n   function resolveProjectRoot(startDir) {\n     const projectMarkers = ['package.json', '.git', 'tasks.json'];\n     let currentDir = startDir;\n     while (currentDir !== path.parse(currentDir).root) {\n       if (projectMarkers.some(marker => fs.existsSync(path.join(currentDir, marker)))) {\n         return currentDir;\n       }\n       currentDir = path.dirname(currentDir);\n     }\n     return startDir; // Fallback to original directory\n   }\n   ```\n\n7. **Environment Variable Overrides**:\n   - Allow users to explicitly set paths:\n   ```javascript\n   const projectRoot = process.env.TASK_MASTER_PROJECT_ROOT || resolveProjectRoot(process.cwd());\n   ```\n\nBy implementing these advanced techniques, task-master can achieve robust path handling across various npm scenarios without requiring manual specification.\n</info added on 2025-04-01T02:25:01.463Z>",

Identify all configuration options that are currently collected through CLI prompts during initialization\n2. Create corresponding command-line flags for each configuration option (e.g., --project-name, --ai-provider, etc.)\n3.

      "title": "Implement Flexible AI Model Management",
      "description": "Currently, Task Master only supports Claude for main operations and Perplexity for research. Users are limited in flexibility when managing AI models. Adding comprehensive support for multiple popular AI models (OpenAI, Ollama, Gemini, OpenRouter, Grok) and providing intuitive CLI commands for model management will significantly enhance usability, transparency, and adaptability to user preferences and project-specific needs. This task will now leverage Vercel's AI SDK to streamline integration and management of these models.",
      "details": "### Proposed Solution\nImplement an intuitive CLI command for AI model management, leveraging Vercel's AI SDK for seamless integration:\n\n- `task-master models`: Lists currently configured models for main operations and research.\n- `task-master models --set-main=\"<model_name>\" --set-research=\"<model_name>\"`: Sets the desired models for main operations and research tasks respectively.\n\nSupported AI Models:\n- **Main Operations:** Claude (current default), OpenAI, Ollama, Gemini, OpenRouter\n- **Research Operations:** Perplexity (current default), OpenAI, Ollama, Grok\n\nIf a user specifies an invalid model, the CLI lists available models clearly.\n\n### Example CLI Usage\n\nList current models:\n```shell\ntask-master models\n```\nOutput example:\n```\nCurrent AI Model Configuration:\n- Main Operations: Claude\n- Research Operations: Perplexity\n```\n\nSet new models:\n```shell\ntask-master models --set-main=\"gemini\" --set-research=\"grok\"\n```\n\nAttempt invalid model:\n```shell\ntask-master models --set-main=\"invalidModel\"\n```\nOutput example:\n```\nError: \"invalidModel\" is not a valid model.\n\nAvailable models for Main Operations:\n- claude\n- openai\n- ollama\n- gemini\n- openrouter\n```\n\n### High-Level Workflow\n1. Update CLI parsing logic to handle new `models` command and associated flags.\n2. Consolidate all AI calls into `ai-services.js` for centralized management.\n3. Utilize Vercel's AI SDK to implement robust wrapper functions for each AI API:\n   - Claude (existing)\n   - Perplexity (existing)\n   - OpenAI\n   - Ollama\n   - Gemini\n   - OpenRouter\n   - Grok\n4. Update environment variables and provide clear documentation in `.env_example`:\n```env\n# MAIN_MODEL options: claude, openai, ollama, gemini, openrouter\nMAIN_MODEL=claude\n\n# RESEARCH_MODEL options: perplexity, openai, ollama, grok\nRESEARCH_MODEL=perplexity\n```\n5. Ensure dynamic model switching via environment variables or configuration management.\n6. Provide clear CLI feedback and validation of model names.\n\n### Vercel AI SDK Integration\n- Use Vercel's AI SDK to abstract API calls for supported models, ensuring consistent error handling and response formatting.\n- Implement a configuration layer to map model names to their respective Vercel SDK integrations.\n- Example pattern for integration:\n```javascript\nimport { createClient } from '@vercel/ai';\n\nconst clients = {\n  claude: createClient({ provider: 'anthropic', apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }),\n  openai: createClient({ provider: 'openai', apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY }),\n  ollama: createClient({ provider: 'ollama', apiKey: process.env.OLLAMA_API_KEY }),\n  gemini: createClient({ provider: 'gemini', apiKey: process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY }),\n  openrouter: createClient({ provider: 'openrouter', apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY }),\n  perplexity: createClient({ provider: 'perplexity', apiKey: process.env.PERPLEXITY_API_KEY }),\n  grok: createClient({ provider: 'grok', apiKey: process.env.GROK_API_KEY })\n};\n\nexport function getClient(model) {\n  if (!clients[model]) {\n    throw new Error(`Invalid model: ${model}`);\n  }\n  return clients[model];\n}\n```\n- Leverage `generateText` and `streamText` functions from the SDK for text generation and streaming capabilities.\n- Ensure compatibility with serverless and edge deployments using Vercel's infrastructure.\n\n### Key Elements\n- Enhanced model visibility and intuitive management commands.\n- Centralized and robust handling of AI API integrations via Vercel AI SDK.\n- Clear CLI responses with detailed validation feedback.\n- Flexible, easy-to-understand environment configuration.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n- Centralize all AI interactions through a single, maintainable module (`ai-services.js`).\n- Ensure comprehensive error handling for invalid model selections.\n- Clearly document environment variable options and their purposes.\n- Validate model names rigorously to prevent runtime errors.\n\n### Out of Scope (Future Considerations)\n- Automatic benchmarking or model performance comparison.\n- Dynamic runtime switching of models based on task type or complexity.",
      "testStrategy": "### Test Strategy\n1. **Unit Tests**:\n   - Test CLI commands for listing, setting, and validating models.\n   - Mock Vercel AI SDK calls to ensure proper integration and error handling.\n\n2. **Integration Tests**:\n   - Validate end-to-end functionality of model management commands.\n   - Test dynamic switching of models via environment variables.\n\n3. **Error Handling Tests**:\n   - Simulate invalid model names and verify error messages.\n   - Test API failures for each model provider and ensure graceful degradation.\n\n4. **Documentation Validation**:\n   - Verify that `.env_example` and CLI usage examples are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n5. **Performance Tests**:\n   - Measure response times for API calls through Vercel AI SDK.\n   - Ensure no significant latency is introduced by model switching.\n\n6. **SDK-Specific Tests**:\n   - Validate the behavior of `generateText` and `streamText` functions for supported models.\n   - Test compatibility with serverless and edge deployments.",

Implement model getters with priority order:\n   - First check `.taskmasterconfig` file\n   - Fall back to environment variables if config file missing/invalid\n   - Use defaults as last resort\n6. Implement model setters that validate input against valid model lists before updating config\n7. Keep API key management in `ai-services.js` using environment variables (don't store keys in config file)\n8. Add helper functions for config file operations:\n   ```javascript\n   function getConfigPath() { /* locate .taskmasterconfig */ }\n   function readConfig() { /* read and parse config file */ }\n   function writeConfig(config) { /* stringify and write config */ }\n   ```\n9.

Implement optional MODEL_MAP for validation:\n   ```javascript\n   const MODEL_MAP = {\n     'openai': ['gpt-3.5-turbo', 'gpt-4', 'gpt-4-turbo'],\n     'anthropic': ['claude-2', 'claude-instant'],\n     'cohere': ['command', 'command-light'],\n     'local': ['llama2', 'mistral']\n   };\n   ```\n\n4. Update getter functions to handle provider/modelId separation:\n   ```javascript\n   function getMainProvider() { /* return provider with fallbacks */ }\n   function getMainModelId() { /* return modelId with fallbacks */ }\n   function getResearchProvider() { /* return provider with fallbacks */ }\n   function getResearchModelId() { /* return modelId with fallbacks */ }\n   ```\n\n5.

Add utility functions for provider-specific validation:\n   ```javascript\n   function isValidProviderModelCombination(provider, modelId) {\n     return MODEL_MAP[provider]?.includes(modelId) || false;\n   }\n   ```\n\n7. Extend unit tests to cover provider/modelId separation, including:\n   - Testing provider validation\n   - Testing provider-modelId combination validation\n   - Verifying getters return correct provider and modelId values\n   - Confirming setters properly validate and store both components\n```\n</info added on 2025-04-14T22:52:29.551Z>",

Replace direct environment variable access with calls to the configuration manager:\n   ```javascript\n   // Before\n   const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;\n   const modelId = process.env.MAIN_MODEL || \"gpt-4\";\n   \n   // After\n   import { getMainProvider, getMainModelId, getMainMaxTokens, getMainTemperature } from './config-manager.js';\n   \n   const provider = getMainProvider();\n   const modelId = getMainModelId();\n   const maxTokens = getMainMaxTokens();\n   const temperature = getMainTemperature();\n   ```\n\n2. Implement model fallback logic using the configuration hierarchy:\n   ```javascript\n   async function processTaskWithFallback(task) {\n     try {\n       return await processWithModel(task, getMainModelId());\n     } catch (error) {\n       logger.warn(`Primary model failed: ${error.message}`);\n       const fallbackModel = getMainFallbackModelId();\n       if (fallbackModel) {\n         return await processWithModel(task, fallbackModel);\n       }\n       throw error;\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Add configuration-aware telemetry points to track model usage and performance:\n   ```javascript\n   function trackModelPerformance(modelId, startTime, success) {\n     const duration = Date.now() - startTime;\n     telemetry.trackEvent('model_usage', {\n       modelId,\n       provider: getMainProvider(),\n       duration,\n       success,\n       configVersion: getConfigVersion()\n     });\n   }\n   ```\n\n4.

          "details": "\n\n<info added on 2025-04-20T03:52:28.196Z>\nThe `updateSubtaskById` function currently makes direct AI calls with hardcoded parameters. When refactoring to use the unified service:\n\n1. Replace direct OpenAI calls with `generateTextService` from `ai-services-unified.js`\n2. Use configuration parameters from `config-manager.js`:\n   - Replace hardcoded model with `getMainModel()`\n   - Use `getMainMaxTokens()` for token limits\n   - Apply `getMainTemperature()` for response randomness\n3. Ensure prompt construction remains consistent but passes these dynamic parameters\n4. Handle API key resolution through the unified service (which uses `resolveEnvVariable`)\n5. Update error handling to work with the unified service response format\n6. If the function uses any logging, ensure it respects `getLoggingEnabled()` setting\n\nExample refactoring pattern:\n```javascript\n// Before\nconst completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n  model: \"gpt-4\",\n  temperature: 0.7,\n  max_tokens: 1000,\n  messages: [/* prompt messages */]\n});\n\n// After\nconst completion = await generateTextService({\n  model: getMainModel(),\n  temperature: getMainTemperature(),\n  max_tokens: getMainMaxTokens(),\n  messages: [/* prompt messages */]\n});\n```\n</info added on 2025-04-20T03:52:28.196Z>\n\n<info added on 2025-04-22T06:05:42.437Z>\n- When testing the non-streaming `generateTextService` call within `updateSubtaskById`, ensure that the function awaits the full response before proceeding with subtask updates. This allows you to validate that the unified service returns the expected structure (e.g., `completion.choices.message.content`) and that error handling logic correctly interprets any error objects or status codes returned by the service.\n\n- Mock or stub the `generateTextService` in unit tests to simulate both successful and failed completions. For example, verify that when the service returns a valid completion, the subtask is updated with the generated content, and when an error is returned, the error handling path is triggered and logged appropriately.\n\n- Confirm that the non-streaming mode does not emit partial results or require event-based handling; the function should only process the final, complete response.\n\n- Example test assertion:\n  ```javascript\n  // Mocked response from generateTextService\n  const mockCompletion = {\n    choices: [{ message: { content: \"Generated subtask details.\" } }]\n  };\n  generateTextService.mockResolvedValue(mockCompletion);\n\n  // Call updateSubtaskById and assert the subtask is updated\n  await updateSubtaskById(...);\n  expect(subtask.details).toBe(\"Generated subtask details.\");\n  ```\n\n- If the unified service supports both streaming and non-streaming modes, explicitly set or verify the `stream` parameter is `false` (or omitted) to ensure non-streaming behavior during these tests.\n</info added on 2025-04-22T06:05:42.437Z>\n\n<info added on 2025-04-22T06:20:19.747Z>\nWhen testing the non-streaming `generateTextService` call in `updateSubtaskById`, implement these verification steps:\n\n1. Add unit tests that verify proper parameter transformation between the old and new implementation:\n   ```javascript\n   test('should correctly transform parameters when calling generateTextService', async () => {\n     // Setup mocks for config values\n     jest.spyOn(configManager, 'getMainModel').mockReturnValue('gpt-4');\n     jest.spyOn(configManager, 'getMainTemperature').mockReturnValue(0.7);\n     jest.spyOn(configManager, 'getMainMaxTokens').mockReturnValue(1000);\n     \n     const generateTextServiceSpy = jest.spyOn(aiServices, 'generateTextService')\n       .mockResolvedValue({ choices: [{ message: { content: 'test content' } }] });\n     \n     await updateSubtaskById(/* params */);\n     \n     // Verify the service was called with correct transformed parameters\n     expect(generateTextServiceSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith({\n       model: 'gpt-4',\n       temperature: 0.7,\n       max_tokens: 1000,\n       messages: expect.any(Array)\n     });\n   });\n   ```\n\n2. Implement response validation to ensure the subtask content is properly extracted:\n   ```javascript\n   // In updateSubtaskById function\n   try {\n     const completion = await generateTextService({\n       // parameters\n     });\n     \n     // Validate response structure before using\n     if (!completion?.choices?.[0]?.message?.content) {\n       throw new Error('Invalid response structure from AI service');\n     }\n     \n     // Continue with updating subtask\n   } catch (error) {\n     // Enhanced error handling\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Add integration tests that verify the end-to-end flow with actual configuration values.\n</info added on 2025-04-22T06:20:19.747Z>\n\n<info added on 2025-04-22T06:23:23.247Z>\n<info added on 2025-04-22T06:35:14.892Z>\nWhen testing the non-streaming `generateTextService` call in `updateSubtaskById`, implement these specific verification steps:\n\n1. Create a dedicated test fixture that isolates the AI service interaction:\n   ```javascript\n   describe('updateSubtaskById AI integration', () => {\n     beforeEach(() => {\n       // Reset all mocks and spies\n       jest.clearAllMocks();\n       // Setup environment with controlled config values\n       process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY = 'test-key';\n     });\n     \n     // Test cases follow...\n   });\n   ```\n\n2. Test error propagation from the unified service:\n   ```javascript\n   test('should properly handle AI service errors', async () => {\n     const mockError = new Error('Service unavailable');\n     mockError.status = 503;\n     jest.spyOn(aiServices, 'generateTextService').mockRejectedValue(mockError);\n     \n     // Capture console errors if needed\n     const consoleSpy = jest.spyOn(console, 'error').mockImplementation();\n     \n     // Execute with error expectation\n     await expect(updateSubtaskById(1, { prompt: 'test' })).rejects.toThrow();\n     \n     // Verify error was logged with appropriate context\n     expect(consoleSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(\n       expect.stringContaining('AI service error'),\n       expect.objectContaining({ status: 503 })\n     );\n   });\n   ```\n\n3. Verify that the function correctly preserves existing subtask content when appending new AI-generated information:\n   ```javascript\n   test('should preserve existing content when appending AI-generated details', async () => {\n     // Setup mock subtask with existing content\n     const mockSubtask = {\n       id: 1,\n       details: 'Existing details.\\n\\n'\n     };\n     \n     // Mock database retrieval\n     getSubtaskById.mockResolvedValue(mockSubtask);\n     \n     // Mock AI response\n     generateTextService.mockResolvedValue({\n       choices: [{ message: { content: 'New AI content.' } }]\n     });\n     \n     await updateSubtaskById(1, { prompt: 'Enhance this subtask' });\n     \n     // Verify the update preserves existing content\n     expect(updateSubtaskInDb).toHaveBeenCalledWith(\n       1,\n       expect.objectContaining({\n         details: expect.stringContaining('Existing details.\\n\\n<info added on')\n       })\n     );\n     \n     // Verify the new content was added\n     expect(updateSubtaskInDb).toHaveBeenCalledWith(\n       1,\n       expect.objectContaining({\n         details: expect.stringContaining('New AI content.')\n       })\n     );\n   });\n   ```\n\n4. Test that the function correctly formats the timestamp and wraps the AI-generated content:\n   ```javascript\n   test('should format timestamp and wrap content correctly', async () => {\n     // Mock date for consistent testing\n     const mockDate = new Date('2025-04-22T10:00:00Z');\n     jest.spyOn(global, 'Date').mockImplementation(() => mockDate);\n     \n     // Setup and execute test\n     // ...\n     \n     // Verify correct formatting\n     expect(updateSubtaskInDb).toHaveBeenCalledWith(\n       expect.any(Number),\n       expect.objectContaining({\n         details: expect.stringMatching(\n           /<info added on 2025-04-22T10:00:00\\.000Z>\\n.*\\n<\\/info added on 2025-04-22T10:00:00\\.000Z>/s\n         )\n       })\n     );\n   });\n   ```\n\n5. Verify that the function correctly handles the case when no existing details are present:\n   ```javascript\n   test('should handle subtasks with no existing details', async () => {\n     // Setup mock subtask with no details\n     const mockSubtask = { id: 1 };\n     getSubtaskById.mockResolvedValue(mockSubtask);\n     \n     // Execute test\n     // ...\n     \n     // Verify details were initialized properly\n     expect(updateSubtaskInDb).toHaveBeenCalledWith(\n       1,\n       expect.objectContaining({\n         details: expect.stringMatching(/^<info added on/)\n       })\n     );\n   });\n   ```\n</info added on 2025-04-22T06:35:14.892Z>\n</info added on 2025-04-22T06:23:23.247Z>",

Ensure backward compatibility by maintaining support for role-based configuration when explicit env vars aren't set\n</info added on 2025-04-20T14:30:12.456Z>\n</info added on 2025-04-20T03:51:51.967Z>\n\n<info added on 2025-04-22T02:41:51.174Z>\n**Implementation Update (Deviation from Original Plan):**\n\n- The configuration management system has been refactored to **eliminate environment variable overrides** (such as `AI_PROVIDER`, `AI_MODEL`, `MAX_TOKENS`, etc.) for all settings except API keys and select endpoints. All configuration values for providers, models, parameters, and logging are now sourced *exclusively* from the loaded `.taskmasterconfig` file (merged with defaults), ensuring a single source of truth.\n\n- The `resolveConfig` and `resolveAIConfig` helpers, which previously checked `process.env` and `session.env`, have been **removed**. All configuration getters now directly access the loaded configuration object.\n\n- A new `MissingConfigError` is thrown if the `.taskmasterconfig` file is not found at startup. This error is caught in the application entrypoint (`ai-services-unified.js`), which then instructs the user to initialize the configuration file before proceeding.\n\n- API key and endpoint resolution remains an exception: environment variable overrides are still supported for secrets like `OPENAI_API_KEY` or provider-specific endpoints, maintaining security best practices.\n\n- Documentation (`README.md`, inline JSDoc, and `.taskmasterconfig` schema) has been updated to clarify that **environment variables are no longer used for general configuration** (other than secrets), and that all settings must be defined in `.taskmasterconfig`.\n\n- All application components have been updated to use the new configuration getters, and any direct access to `CONFIG`, `process.env`, or the previous helpers has been removed.\n\n- This stricter approach enforces configuration-as-code principles, ensures reproducibility, and prevents configuration drift, aligning with modern best practices for immutable infrastructure and automated configuration management[2][4].\n</info added on 2025-04-22T02:41:51.174Z>",

Setup test fixtures:\n   - Create a mock `.taskmasterconfig` file with different provider configurations\n   - Define test cases with various model selections and parameter settings\n   - Use environment variable mocks only for API keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)\n\n2. Test configuration resolution:\n   - Verify that `ai-services-unified.js` correctly retrieves settings from `config-manager.js`\n   - Test that model selection follows the hierarchy defined in `.taskmasterconfig`\n   - Ensure fallback mechanisms work when primary providers are unavailable\n\n3. Mock the provider modules:\n   ```javascript\n   jest.mock('../services/openai-service.js');\n   jest.mock('../services/anthropic-service.js');\n   ```\n\n4. Test specific scenarios:\n   - Provider selection based on configured preferences\n   - Parameter inheritance from config (temperature, maxTokens)\n   - Error handling when API keys are missing\n   - Proper routing when specific models are requested\n\n5. Verify integration with task-manager:\n   ```javascript\n   test('task-manager correctly uses unified AI service with config-based settings', async () => {\n     // Setup mock config with specific settings\n     mockConfigManager.getAIProviderPreference.mockReturnValue(['openai', 'anthropic']);\n     mockConfigManager.getModelForRole.mockReturnValue('gpt-4');\n     mockConfigManager.getParametersForModel.mockReturnValue({ temperature: 0.7, maxTokens: 2000 });\n     \n     // Verify task-manager uses these settings when calling the unified service\n     // ...\n   });\n   ```\n\n6.

Replace direct `process.env.API_KEY` access.\n2.  **Centralize App Configuration**: Ensure all non-sensitive configuration values (model names, temperature, logging levels, max tokens, etc.) are accessed *only* through `scripts/modules/config-manager.js` getters. Eliminate direct `process.env` access for these.\n\n**Strategy: Inventory -> Analyze -> Target -> Refine**\n\n1.  **Inventory (`process.env` Usage):** Performed grep search (`rg \"process\\.env\"`). Results indicate widespread usage across multiple files.\n2.  **Analysis (Categorization of Usage):**\n    *   **API Keys (Credentials):** ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, PERPLEXITY_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc. found in `task-manager.js`, `ai-services.js`, `commands.js`, `dependency-manager.js`, `ai-client-utils.js`, test files. Needs replacement with `resolveEnvVariable(key, session)`.\n    *   **App Configuration:** PERPLEXITY_MODEL, TEMPERATURE, MAX_TOKENS, MODEL, DEBUG, LOG_LEVEL, DEFAULT_*, PROJECT_*, TASK_MASTER_PROJECT_ROOT found in `task-manager.js`, `ai-services.js`, `scripts/init.js`, `mcp-server/src/logger.js`, `mcp-server/src/tools/utils.js`, test files. Needs replacement with `config-manager.js` getters.\n    *   **System/Environment Info:** HOME, USERPROFILE, SHELL in `scripts/init.js`. Needs review (e.g., `os.homedir()` preference).\n    *   **Test Code/Setup:** Extensive usage in test files. Acceptable for mocking, but code under test must use standard methods. May require test adjustments.\n    *   **Helper Functions/Comments:** Definitions/comments about `resolveEnvVariable`. No action needed.\n3.  **Target (High-Impact Areas & Initial Focus):**\n    *   High Impact: `task-manager.js` (~5800 lines), `ai-services.js` (~1500 lines).\n    *   Medium Impact: `commands.js`, Test Files.\n    *   Foundational: `ai-client-utils.js`, `config-manager.js`, `utils.js`.\n    *   **Initial Target Command:** `task-master analyze-complexity` for a focused, end-to-end refactoring exercise.\n\n4.  **Refine (Plan for `analyze-complexity`):**\n    a.  **Trace Code Path:** Identify functions involved in `analyze-complexity`.\n    b.  **Refactor API Key Access:** Replace direct `process.env.PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` with `resolveEnvVariable(key, session)`.\n    c.  **Refactor App Config Access:** Replace direct `process.env` for model name, temp, tokens with `config-manager.js` getters.\n    d.  **Verify `resolveEnvVariable`:** Ensure robustness, especially handling potentially undefined `session`.\n    e.  **Test:** Verify command works locally and via MCP context (if possible). Update tests.\n\nThis piecemeal approach aims to establish the refactoring pattern before tackling the entire codebase.\n</info added on 2025-04-20T06:58:36.731Z>",
