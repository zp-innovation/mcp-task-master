Create comprehensive tests for tool registration and resource access\n\n<info added on 2025-03-31T18:35:21.513Z>\nHere is additional information to enhance the subtask regarding resources and resource templates in FastMCP:\n\nResources in FastMCP are used to expose static or dynamic data to LLM clients. For the Task Master MCP server, we should implement resources to provide:\n\n1. Task templates: Predefined task structures that can be used as starting points\n2. Workflow definitions: Reusable workflow patterns for common task sequences\n3. User preferences: Stored user settings for task management\n4. Project metadata: Information about active projects and their attributes\n\nResource implementation should follow this structure:\n\n```python\n@mcp.resource(\"tasks://templates/{template_id}\")\ndef get_task_template(template_id: str) -> dict:\n    # Fetch and return the specified task template\n    ...\n\n@mcp.resource(\"workflows://definitions/{workflow_id}\")\ndef get_workflow_definition(workflow_id: str) -> dict:\n    # Fetch and return the specified workflow definition\n    ...\n\n@mcp.resource(\"users://{user_id}/preferences\")\ndef get_user_preferences(user_id: str) -> dict:\n    # Fetch and return user preferences\n    ...\n\n@mcp.resource(\"projects://metadata\")\ndef get_project_metadata() -> List[dict]:\n    # Fetch and return metadata for all active projects\n    ...\n```\n\nResource templates in FastMCP allow for dynamic generation of resources based on patterns. For Task Master, we can implement:\n\n1. Dynamic task creation templates\n2. Customizable workflow templates\n3. User-specific resource views\n\nExample implementation:\n\n```python\n@mcp.resource(\"tasks://create/{task_type}\")\ndef get_task_creation_template(task_type: str) -> dict:\n    # Generate and return a task creation template based on task_type\n    ...\n\n@mcp.resource(\"workflows://custom/{user_id}/{workflow_name}\")\ndef get_custom_workflow_template(user_id: str, workflow_name: str) -> dict:\n    # Generate and return a custom workflow template for the user\n    ...\n\n@mcp.resource(\"users://{user_id}/dashboard\")\ndef get_user_dashboard(user_id: str) -> dict:\n    # Generate and return a personalized dashboard view for the user\n    ...\n```\n\nBest practices for integrating resources with Task Master functionality:\n\n1. Use resources to provide context and data for tools\n2. Implement caching for frequently accessed resources\n3. Ensure proper error handling and not-found cases for all resources\n4. Use resource templates to generate dynamic, personalized views of data\n5. Implement access control to ensure users only access authorized resources\n\nBy properly implementing these resources and resource templates, we can provide rich, contextual data to LLM clients, enhancing the Task Master's capabilities and user experience.\n</info added on 2025-03-31T18:35:21.513Z>",

Use `path.join()` and `path.resolve()` for cross-platform path handling\n2. Avoid hardcoded forward/backslashes in paths\n3. Use `os.homedir()` for user home directory references\n\n### Best Practices for Path Resolution\n\n1. **Absolute vs Relative Paths**:\n   - Always convert relative paths to absolute using `path.resolve()`\n   - Use `path.isAbsolute()` to check if a path is already absolute\n\n2. **Handling Different Installation Scenarios**:\n   - Local dev: Use `process.cwd()` as fallback project root\n   - Local dependency: Resolve paths relative to consuming project\n   - Global install: Use `process.execPath` to locate global `node_modules`\n\n3. **Configuration Options**:\n   - Allow users to specify custom project root via CLI option or config file\n   - Implement a clear precedence order for path resolution (e.g., CLI option > config file > auto-detection)\n\n4. **Error Handling**:\n   - Provide clear error messages when critical paths cannot be resolved\n   - Implement retry logic with alternative methods if primary path detection fails\n\n5. **Documentation**:\n   - Clearly document path handling behavior in README and inline comments\n   - Provide examples for common scenarios and edge cases\n\nBy implementing these practices, the MCP tools can achieve consistent and robust path handling across various npm installation and usage scenarios.\n</info added on 2025-04-01T02:21:57.137Z>\n\n<info added on 2025-04-01T02:25:01.463Z>\nHere's additional information addressing the request for clarification on path handling challenges for npm packages:\n\n## Advanced Path Handling Challenges and Solutions\n\n### Challenges to Avoid\n\n1. **Relying solely on process.cwd()**:\n   - Global installs: process.cwd() could be any directory\n   - Local installs as dependency: points to parent project's root\n   - Users may run commands from subdirectories\n\n2. **Dual Path Requirements**:\n   - Package Path: Where task-master code is installed\n   - Project Path: Where user's tasks.json resides\n\n3. **Specific Edge Cases**:\n   - Non-project directory execution\n   - Deeply nested project structures\n   - Yarn/pnpm workspaces\n   - Monorepos with multiple tasks.json files\n   - Commands invoked from scripts in different directories\n\n### Advanced Solutions\n\n1. **Project Marker Detection**:\n   - Implement recursive search for package.json or .git\n   - Use `find-up` package for efficient directory traversal\n   ```javascript\n   const findUp = require('find-up');\n   const projectRoot = await findUp(dir => findUp.sync('package.json', { cwd: dir }));\n   ```\n\n2. **Package Path Resolution**:\n   - Leverage `import.meta.url` with `fileURLToPath`:\n   ```javascript\n   import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';\n   import path from 'path';\n   \n   const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);\n   const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);\n   const packageRoot = path.resolve(__dirname, '..');\n   ```\n\n3. **Workspace-Aware Resolution**:\n   - Detect Yarn/pnpm workspaces:\n   ```javascript\n   const findWorkspaceRoot = require('find-yarn-workspace-root');\n   const workspaceRoot = findWorkspaceRoot(process.cwd());\n   ```\n\n4. **Monorepo Handling**:\n   - Implement cascading configuration search\n   - Allow multiple tasks.json files with clear precedence rules\n\n5. **CLI Tool Inspiration**:\n   - ESLint: Uses `eslint-find-rule-files` for config discovery\n   - Jest: Implements `jest-resolve` for custom module resolution\n   - Next.js: Uses `find-up` to locate project directories\n\n6. **Robust Path Resolution Algorithm**:\n   ```javascript\n   function resolveProjectRoot(startDir) {\n     const projectMarkers = ['package.json', '.git', 'tasks.json'];\n     let currentDir = startDir;\n     while (currentDir !== path.parse(currentDir).root) {\n       if (projectMarkers.some(marker => fs.existsSync(path.join(currentDir, marker)))) {\n         return currentDir;\n       }\n       currentDir = path.dirname(currentDir);\n     }\n     return startDir; // Fallback to original directory\n   }\n   ```\n\n7. **Environment Variable Overrides**:\n   - Allow users to explicitly set paths:\n   ```javascript\n   const projectRoot = process.env.TASK_MASTER_PROJECT_ROOT || resolveProjectRoot(process.cwd());\n   ```\n\nBy implementing these advanced techniques, task-master can achieve robust path handling across various npm scenarios without requiring manual specification.\n</info added on 2025-04-01T02:25:01.463Z>",

Identify all configuration options that are currently collected through CLI prompts during initialization\n2.

This eliminates the need for separate APIs or SDKs for each service. The goal is to create a standardized, agnostic system that facilitates seamless task execution and interaction with external systems. Additionally, the system should support two operational modes: **solo/local mode**, where tasks are managed locally using a `tasks.json` file, and **multiplayer/remote mode**, where tasks are managed via external MCP integrations.

Adding comprehensive support for multiple popular AI models (OpenAI, Ollama, Gemini, OpenRouter, Grok) and providing intuitive CLI commands for model management will significantly enhance usability, transparency, and adaptability to user preferences and project-specific needs. This task will now leverage Vercel's AI SDK to streamline integration and management of these models.",

Update CLI parsing logic to handle new `models` command and associated flags.\n2. Consolidate all AI calls into `ai-services.js` for centralized management.\n3. Utilize Vercel's AI SDK to implement robust wrapper functions for each AI API:\n   - Claude (existing)\n   - Perplexity (existing)\n   - OpenAI\n   - Ollama\n   - Gemini\n   - OpenRouter\n   - Grok\n4.

Ensure dynamic model switching via environment variables or configuration management.\n6. Provide clear CLI feedback and validation of model names.\n\n### Vercel AI SDK Integration\n- Use Vercel's AI SDK to abstract API calls for supported models, ensuring consistent error handling and response formatting.\n- Implement a configuration layer to map model names to their respective Vercel SDK integrations.\n- Example pattern for integration:\n```javascript\nimport { createClient } from '@vercel/ai';\n\nconst clients = {\n  claude: createClient({ provider: 'anthropic', apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }),\n  openai: createClient({ provider: 'openai', apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY }),\n  ollama: createClient({ provider: 'ollama', apiKey: process.env.OLLAMA_API_KEY }),\n  gemini: createClient({ provider: 'gemini', apiKey: process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY }),\n  openrouter: createClient({ provider: 'openrouter', apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY }),\n  perplexity: createClient({ provider: 'perplexity', apiKey: process.env.PERPLEXITY_API_KEY }),\n  grok: createClient({ provider: 'xai', apiKey: process.env.XAI_API_KEY })\n};\n\nexport function getClient(model) {\n  if (!clients[model]) {\n    throw new Error(`Invalid model: ${model}`);\n  }\n  return clients[model];\n}\n```\n- Leverage `generateText` and `streamText` functions from the SDK for text generation and streaming capabilities.\n- Ensure compatibility with serverless and edge deployments using Vercel's infrastructure.\n\n### Key Elements\n- Enhanced model visibility and intuitive management commands.\n- Centralized and robust handling of AI API integrations via Vercel AI SDK.\n- Clear CLI responses with detailed validation feedback.\n- Flexible, easy-to-understand environment configuration.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n- Centralize all AI interactions through a single, maintainable module (`ai-services.js`).\n- Ensure comprehensive error handling for invalid model selections.\n- Clearly document environment variable options and their purposes.\n- Validate model names rigorously to prevent runtime errors.\n\n### Out of Scope (Future Considerations)\n- Automatic benchmarking or model performance comparison.\n- Dynamic runtime switching of models based on task type or complexity.",

Use a `.taskmasterconfig` JSON file in the project root directory to store model settings\n2. Structure the config file with two main keys: `main` and `research` for respective model selections\n3. Implement functions to locate the project root directory (using package.json as reference)\n4. Define constants for valid models:\n   ```javascript\n   const VALID_MAIN_MODELS = ['gpt-4', 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'gpt-4-turbo'];\n   const VALID_RESEARCH_MODELS = ['gpt-4', 'gpt-4-turbo', 'claude-2'];\n   const DEFAULT_MAIN_MODEL = 'gpt-3.5-turbo';\n   const DEFAULT_RESEARCH_MODEL = 'gpt-4';\n   ```\n5. Implement model getters with priority order:\n   - First check `.taskmasterconfig` file\n   - Fall back to environment variables if config file missing/invalid\n   - Use defaults as last resort\n6. Implement model setters that validate input against valid model lists before updating config\n7. Keep API key management in `ai-services.js` using environment variables (don't store keys in config file)\n8. Add helper functions for config file operations:\n   ```javascript\n   function getConfigPath() { /* locate .taskmasterconfig */ }\n   function readConfig() { /* read and parse config file */ }\n   function writeConfig(config) { /* stringify and write config */ }\n   ```\n9. Include error handling for file operations and invalid configurations\n```\n</info added on 2025-04-14T21:54:28.887Z>\n\n<info added on 2025-04-14T22:52:29.551Z>\n```\nThe configuration management module should be updated to:\n\n1. Separate model configuration into provider and modelId components:\n   ```javascript\n   // Example config structure\n   {\n     \"models\": {\n       \"main\": {\n         \"provider\": \"openai\",\n         \"modelId\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\"\n       },\n       \"research\": {\n         \"provider\": \"openai\",\n         \"modelId\": \"gpt-4\"\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. Define provider constants:\n   ```javascript\n   const VALID_MAIN_PROVIDERS = ['openai', 'anthropic', 'local'];\n   const VALID_RESEARCH_PROVIDERS = ['openai', 'anthropic', 'cohere'];\n   const DEFAULT_MAIN_PROVIDER = 'openai';\n   const DEFAULT_RESEARCH_PROVIDER = 'openai';\n   ```\n\n3. Implement optional MODEL_MAP for validation:\n   ```javascript\n   const MODEL_MAP = {\n     'openai': ['gpt-3.5-turbo', 'gpt-4', 'gpt-4-turbo'],\n     'anthropic': ['claude-2', 'claude-instant'],\n     'cohere': ['command', 'command-light'],\n     'local': ['llama2', 'mistral']\n   };\n   ```\n\n4. Update getter functions to handle provider/modelId separation:\n   ```javascript\n   function getMainProvider() { /* return provider with fallbacks */ }\n   function getMainModelId() { /* return modelId with fallbacks */ }\n   function getResearchProvider() { /* return provider with fallbacks */ }\n   function getResearchModelId() { /* return modelId with fallbacks */ }\n   ```\n\n5. Update setter functions to validate both provider and modelId:\n   ```javascript\n   function setMainModel(provider, modelId) {\n     // Validate provider is in VALID_MAIN_PROVIDERS\n     // Optionally validate modelId is valid for provider using MODEL_MAP\n     // Update config file with new values\n   }\n   ```\n\n6. Add utility functions for provider-specific validation:\n   ```javascript\n   function isValidProviderModelCombination(provider, modelId) {\n     return MODEL_MAP[provider]?.includes(modelId) || false;\n   }\n   ```\n\n7. Extend unit tests to cover provider/modelId separation, including:\n   - Testing provider validation\n   - Testing provider-modelId combination validation\n   - Verifying getters return correct provider and modelId values\n   - Confirming setters properly validate and store both components\n```\n</info added on 2025-04-14T22:52:29.551Z>",

For example, verify that when the service returns a valid completion, the subtask is updated with the generated content, and when an error is returned, the error handling path is triggered and logged appropriately.\n\n- Confirm that the non-streaming mode does not emit partial results or require event-based handling; the function should only process the final, complete response.\n\n- Example test assertion:\n  ```javascript\n  // Mocked response from generateTextService\n  const mockCompletion = {\n    choices: [{ message: { content: \"Generated subtask details.\" } }]\n  };\n  generateTextService.mockResolvedValue(mockCompletion);\n\n  // Call updateSubtaskById and assert the subtask is updated\n  await updateSubtaskById(...);\n  expect(subtask.details).toBe(\"Generated subtask details.\");\n  ```\n\n- If the unified service supports both streaming and non-streaming modes, explicitly set or verify the `stream` parameter is `false` (or omitted) to ensure non-streaming behavior during these tests.\n</info added on 2025-04-22T06:05:42.437Z>\n\n<info added on 2025-04-22T06:20:19.747Z>\nWhen testing the non-streaming `generateTextService` call in `updateSubtaskById`, implement these verification steps:\n\n1.

          "details": "\n\n<info added on 2025-04-24T02:54:40.326Z>\n- Use the `@ai-sdk/anthropic` package to implement the provider module. You can import the default provider instance with `import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic'`, or create a custom instance using `createAnthropic` if you need to specify custom headers, API key, or base URL (such as for beta features or proxying)[1][4].\n\n- To address persistent 'Not Found' errors, ensure the model name matches the latest Anthropic model IDs (e.g., `claude-3-haiku-20240307`, `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`). Model naming is case-sensitive and must match Anthropic's published versions[4][5].\n\n- If you require custom headers (such as for beta features), use the `createAnthropic` function and pass a `headers` object. For example:\n  ```js\n  import { createAnthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';\n  const anthropic = createAnthropic({\n    apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,\n    headers: { 'anthropic-beta': 'tools-2024-04-04' }\n  });\n  ```\n\n- For streaming and non-streaming support, the Vercel AI SDK provides both `generateText` (non-streaming) and `streamText` (streaming) functions. Use these with the Anthropic provider instance as the `model` parameter[5].\n\n- Example usage for non-streaming:\n  ```js\n  import { generateText } from 'ai';\n  import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';\n\n  const result = await generateText({\n    model: anthropic('claude-3-haiku-20240307'),\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: [{ type: 'text', text: 'Hello!' }] }]\n  });\n  ```\n\n- Example usage for streaming:\n  ```js\n  import { streamText } from 'ai';\n  import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';\n\n  const stream = await streamText({\n    model: anthropic('claude-3-haiku-20240307'),\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: [{ type: 'text', text: 'Hello!' }] }]\n  });\n  ```\n\n- Ensure that your implementation adheres to the standardized input/output format defined for `ai-services-unified.js`, mapping the SDK's response structure to your unified format.\n\n- If you continue to encounter 'Not Found' errors, verify:\n  - The API key is valid and has access to the requested models.\n  - The model name is correct and available to your Anthropic account.\n  - Any required beta headers are included if using beta features or models[1].\n\n- Prefer direct provider instantiation with explicit headers and API key configuration for maximum compatibility and to avoid SDK-level abstraction issues[1].\n</info added on 2025-04-24T02:54:40.326Z>",

Document the priority order (env vars > session.env > .taskmasterconfig) in JSDoc comments\n5. Ensure backward compatibility by maintaining support for role-based configuration when explicit env vars aren't set\n</info added on 2025-04-20T14:30:12.456Z>\n</info added on 2025-04-20T03:51:51.967Z>\n\n<info added on 2025-04-22T02:41:51.174Z>\n**Implementation Update (Deviation from Original Plan):**\n\n- The configuration management system has been refactored to **eliminate environment variable overrides** (such as `AI_PROVIDER`, `AI_MODEL`, `MAX_TOKENS`, etc.) for all settings except API keys and select endpoints. All configuration values for providers, models, parameters, and logging are now sourced *exclusively* from the loaded `.taskmasterconfig` file (merged with defaults), ensuring a single source of truth.\n\n- The `resolveConfig` and `resolveAIConfig` helpers, which previously checked `process.env` and `session.env`, have been **removed**. All configuration getters now directly access the loaded configuration object.\n\n- A new `MissingConfigError` is thrown if the `.taskmasterconfig` file is not found at startup. This error is caught in the application entrypoint (`ai-services-unified.js`), which then instructs the user to initialize the configuration file before proceeding.\n\n- API key and endpoint resolution remains an exception: environment variable overrides are still supported for secrets like `OPENAI_API_KEY` or provider-specific endpoints, maintaining security best practices.\n\n- Documentation (`README.md`, inline JSDoc, and `.taskmasterconfig` schema) has been updated to clarify that **environment variables are no longer used for general configuration** (other than secrets), and that all settings must be defined in `.taskmasterconfig`.\n\n- All application components have been updated to use the new configuration getters, and any direct access to `CONFIG`, `process.env`, or the previous helpers has been removed.\n\n- This stricter approach enforces configuration-as-code principles, ensures reproducibility, and prevents configuration drift, aligning with modern best practices for immutable infrastructure and automated configuration management[2][4].\n</info added on 2025-04-22T02:41:51.174Z>",

          "details": "\n\n<info added on 2025-04-24T17:45:51.956Z>\n## Additional Implementation Notes for Refactoring\n\n**General Guidance**\n\n- Ensure all AI-related logic in `analyze-task-complexity.js` is abstracted behind the `generateObjectService` interface. The function should only specify *what* to generate (schema, prompt, and parameters), not *how* the AI call is made or which model/config is used.\n- Remove any code that directly fetches AI model parameters or credentials from configuration files. All such details must be handled by the unified service layer.\n\n**1. Core Logic Function (analyze-task-complexity.js)**\n\n- Refactor the function signature to accept a `session` object and a `role` parameter, in addition to the existing arguments.\n- When preparing the service call, construct a payload object containing:\n  - The Zod schema for expected output.\n  - The prompt or input for the AI.\n  - The `role` (e.g., \"researcher\" or \"default\") based on the `useResearch` flag.\n  - The `session` context for downstream configuration and authentication.\n- Example service call:\n  ```js\n  const result = await generateObjectService({\n    schema: complexitySchema,\n    prompt: buildPrompt(task, options),\n    role,\n    session,\n  });\n  ```\n- Remove all references to direct AI client instantiation or configuration fetching.\n\n**2. CLI Command Action Handler (commands.js)**\n\n- Ensure the CLI handler for `analyze-complexity`:\n  - Accepts and parses the `--use-research` flag (or equivalent).\n  - Passes the `useResearch` flag and the current session context to the core function.\n  - Handles errors from the unified service gracefully, providing user-friendly feedback.\n\n**3. MCP Tool Definition (mcp-server/src/tools/analyze.js)**\n\n- Align the Zod schema for CLI options with the parameters expected by the core function, including `useResearch` and any new required fields.\n- Use `getMCPProjectRoot` to resolve the project path before invoking the core function.\n- Add status logging before and after the analysis, e.g., \"Analyzing task complexity...\" and \"Analysis complete.\"\n- Ensure the tool calls the core function with all required parameters, including session and resolved paths.\n\n**4. MCP Direct Function Wrapper (mcp-server/src/core/direct-functions/analyze-complexity-direct.js)**\n\n- Remove any direct AI client or config usage.\n- Implement a logger wrapper that standardizes log output for this function (e.g., `logger.info`, `logger.error`).\n- Pass the session context through to the core function to ensure all environment/config access is centralized.\n- Return a standardized response object, e.g.:\n  ```js\n  return {\n    success: true,\n    data: analysisResult,\n    message: \"Task complexity analysis completed.\",\n  };\n  ```\n\n**Testing and Validation**\n\n- After refactoring, add or update tests to ensure:\n  - The function does not break if AI service configuration changes.\n  - The correct role and session are always passed to the unified service.\n  - Errors from the unified service are handled and surfaced appropriately.\n\n**Best Practices**\n\n- Keep the core logic function pure and focused on orchestration, not implementation details.\n- Use dependency injection for session/context to facilitate testing and future extensibility.\n- Document the expected structure of the session and role parameters for maintainability.\n\nThese enhancements will ensure the refactored code is modular, maintainable, and fully decoupled from AI implementation details, aligning with modern refactoring best practices[1][3][5].\n</info added on 2025-04-24T17:45:51.956Z>",

This centralizes AI config management and supports future service changes without further refactoring.\n\n- When preparing the service call, construct the payload to include both the prompt and any schema or validation requirements expected by generateObjectService. For example, if subtasks must conform to a Zod schema, pass the schema definition or reference as part of the call.\n\n- For the CLI handler, ensure that the --research flag is mapped to the useResearch boolean and that this is explicitly passed to the core expand-task logic. Also, propagate any session or user context from CLI options to the core function for downstream auditing or personalization.\n\n- In the MCP tool definition, validate that all CLI-exposed parameters are reflected in the Zod schema, including optional ones like prompt overrides or force regeneration.

'researcher' : 'default';\n  ```\n\n- **Error Handling**:  \n  Implement structured error handling:\n  ```js\n  try {\n    // AI service call\n  } catch (err) {\n    if (err.name === 'ServiceUnavailableError') {\n      // Handle AI service unavailability\n    } else if (err.name === 'ZodError') {\n      // Handle schema validation errors\n      // err.errors contains detailed validation issues\n    } else if (err.name === 'PromptConstructionError') {\n      // Handle prompt construction issues\n    } else {\n      // Handle unexpected errors\n    }\n    throw err; // or wrap and rethrow as needed\n  }\n  ```\n  This pattern ensures that consumers can distinguish between different failure modes and respond appropriately.\n\n- **Consumer Contract**:  \n  Update the function signature to require both `useResearch` and `session` parameters, and document this in JSDoc/type annotations for clarity.\n\n- **Prompt Construction**:  \n  Move all prompt construction logic outside the core function if possible, or encapsulate it so that errors can be caught and reported as `PromptConstructionError`.\n\n- **No AI Implementation Details**:  \n  The refactored function should not expose or depend on any AI implementation specifics—only the unified service interface and schema validation.\n\n- **Testing**:  \n  Add or update tests to cover:\n  - Successful subtask generation\n  - Schema validation failures (invalid AI output)\n  - Service unavailability scenarios\n  - Prompt construction errors\n\nThese enhancements ensure the refactored file is robust, maintainable, and aligned with the unified AI service architecture, leveraging Zod for strict runtime validation and clear error boundaries[5][1][3].\n</info added on 2025-04-24T17:48:35.005Z>",

This approach helps separate validation logic from business logic and ensures type safety throughout the update process[1][2].\n\n- For the core logic, use Zod's `.implement()` method to wrap the update function, so that all inputs (such as task ID, prompt, and options) are validated before execution, and outputs are type-checked. This reduces runtime errors and enforces contract compliance between layers[1][2].\n\n- In the MCP tool definition, ensure that the Zod schema explicitly validates all required parameters (e.g., `id` as a string, `prompt` as a string, `research` as a boolean or optional flag). This guarantees that only well-formed requests reach the core logic, improving reliability and error reporting[3][5].\n\n- When preparing the unified AI service call, pass the validated and sanitized data from the Zod schema directly to `generateObjectService`, ensuring that no unvalidated data is sent to the AI layer.\n\n- For output formatting, leverage Zod's ability to define and enforce the shape of the returned object, ensuring that the response structure (including success/failure status and updated task data) is always consistent and predictable[1][2][3].\n\n- If you need to validate or transform nested objects (such as task metadata or options), use Zod's object and nested schema capabilities to define these structures precisely, catching errors early and simplifying downstream logic[3][5].\n</info added on 2025-04-24T17:48:58.133Z>",

For example, if updating tasks requires an array of task objects with specific fields, use:\n  ```typescript\n  import { z } from \"zod\";\n\n  const TaskUpdateSchema = z.object({\n    id: z.number(),\n    status: z.string(),\n    // add other fields as needed\n  });\n\n  const BatchUpdateSchema = z.object({\n    tasks: z.array(TaskUpdateSchema),\n    from: z.number(),\n    prompt: z.string().optional(),\n    useResearch: z.boolean().optional(),\n  });\n  ```\n  This ensures all incoming data for batch updates is validated at runtime, catching malformed input early and providing clear error messages[4][5].\n\n- **Function Schema Validation**:  \n  If exposing the update logic as a callable function (e.g., for CLI or API), consider using Zod's function schema to validate both input and output:\n  ```typescript\n  const updateTasksFunction = z\n    .function()\n    .args(BatchUpdateSchema, z.object({ session: z.any() }))\n    .returns(z.promise(z.object({ success: z.boolean(), updated: z.number() })))\n    .implement(async (input, { session }) => {\n      // implementation here\n    });\n  ```\n  This pattern enforces correct usage and output shape, improving reliability[1].\n\n- **Error Handling and Reporting**:  \n  Use Zod's `.safeParse()` or `.parse()` methods to validate input. On validation failure, return or throw a formatted error to the caller (CLI, API, etc.), ensuring actionable feedback for users[5].\n\n- **Consistent JSON Output**:  \n  When invoking the core update function from wrappers (CLI, MCP), ensure the output is always serialized as JSON. This is critical for downstream consumers and for automated tooling.\n\n- **Logger Wrapper Example**:  \n  Implement a logger utility that can be toggled for silent mode:\n  ```typescript\n  function createLogger(silent: boolean) {\n    return {\n      log: (...args: any[]) => { if (!silent) console.log(...args); },\n      error: (...args: any[]) => { if (!silent) console.error(...args); }\n    };\n  }\n  ```\n  Pass this logger to the core logic for consistent, suppressible output.\n\n- **Session Context Usage**:  \n  Ensure all AI service calls and config access are routed through the provided session context, not global config getters. This supports multi-user and multi-session environments.\n\n- **Task Filtering Logic**:  \n  Before invoking the AI service, filter the tasks array to only include those with `id >= from` and `status === \"pending\"`. This preserves the intended batch update semantics.\n\n- **Preserve File Regeneration**:  \n  After updating tasks, ensure any logic that regenerates or writes task files is retained and invoked as before.\n\n- **CLI and API Parameter Validation**:  \n  Use the same Zod schemas to validate CLI arguments and API payloads, ensuring consistency across all entry points[5].\n\n- **Example: Validating CLI Arguments**\n  ```typescript\n  const cliArgsSchema = z.object({\n    from: z.string().regex(/^\\d+$/).transform(Number),\n    research: z.boolean().optional(),\n    session: z.any(),\n  });\n\n  const parsedArgs = cliArgsSchema.parse(cliArgs);\n  ```\n\nThese enhancements ensure robust validation, unified service usage, and maintainable, predictable batch update behavior.\n</info added on 2025-04-24T17:49:25.126Z>",

Identify all files within the project directory that contain console log statements:\n   - Use grep or similar tools: `grep -r \"console.log\" --include=\"*.js\" --include=\"*.jsx\" --include=\"*.ts\" --include=\"*.tsx\" ./src`\n   - Alternatively, use your IDE's project-wide search functionality with regex pattern `console\\.(log|debug|info|warn|error)`\n\n2. Categorize console logs:\n   - Essential logs: Error reporting, critical application state changes\n   - Debugging logs: Temporary logs used during development\n   - Informational logs: Non-critical information that might be useful\n   - Redundant logs: Duplicated information or trivial data\n\n3. Create a spreadsheet or document to track:\n   - File path\n   - Line number\n   - Console log content\n   - Category (essential/debugging/informational/redundant)\n   - Decision (keep/remove)\n\n4. Apply these specific removal criteria:\n   - Remove all logs with comments like \"TODO\", \"TEMP\", \"DEBUG\"\n   - Remove logs that only show function entry/exit without meaningful data\n   - Remove logs that duplicate information already available in the UI\n   - Keep logs related to error handling or critical user actions\n   - Consider replacing some logs with proper error handling\n\n5. For logs you decide to keep:\n   - Add clear comments explaining why they're necessary\n   - Consider moving them to a centralized logging service\n   - Implement log levels (debug, info, warn, error) if not already present\n\n6. Use search and replace with regex to batch remove similar patterns:\n   - Example: `console\\.log\\(\\s*['\"]Processing.*?['\"]\\s*\\);`\n\n7. After removal, implement these testing steps:\n   - Run all unit tests\n   - Check browser console for any remaining logs during manual testing\n   - Verify error handling still works properly\n   - Test edge cases where logs might have been masking issues\n\n8. Consider implementing a linting rule to prevent unnecessary console logs in future code:\n   - Add ESLint rule \"no-console\" with appropriate exceptions\n   - Configure CI/CD pipeline to fail if new console logs are added\n\n9. Document any logging standards for the team to follow going forward.\n\n10.

This allows your config manager to control credential sourcing via environment, profiles, or IAM roles, consistent with other AWS integrations[1].\n\n- Example integration with config manager:\n  ```js\n  import { createAmazonBedrock } from '@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock';\n  import { fromNodeProviderChain } from '@aws-sdk/credential-providers';\n\n  // Assume configManager.get returns your config values\n  const region = configManager.get('bedrock.region');\n  const model = configManager.get('bedrock.model');\n\n  const bedrock = createAmazonBedrock({\n    region,\n    credentialProvider: fromNodeProviderChain(),\n  });\n\n  // Use with AI SDK methods\n  const { text } = await generateText({\n    model: bedrock(model),\n    prompt: 'Your prompt here',\n  });\n  ```\n\n- If your config manager supports dynamic provider selection, you can abstract the provider initialization so switching between Bedrock and other providers (like OpenAI or Anthropic) is seamless.\n\n- Be aware that Bedrock exposes multiple models from different vendors, each with potentially different API behaviors. Your config should allow specifying the exact model string, and your integration should handle any model-specific options or response formats[5].\n\n- For unified service integration, ensure your service layer can route requests to Bedrock using the configured provider instance, and normalize responses if you support multiple AI backends.\n</info added on 2025-04-25T19:03:42.584Z>",

Document specific Yarn-related environment variables that might affect website connectivity. Use tools like Playwright or Cypress to automate the account setup flow testing, capturing screenshots at each step for documentation.

Create a checklist of all UI elements that should be verified during the account setup process, including form validation, error messages, and success states.

Validate that redirect URIs, token exchanges, and session persistence behave as expected across all supported browsers.\n\n- If the website setup involves configuring application pools or web server settings (e.g., with IIS), document any Yarn-specific considerations, such as environment variable propagation or file permission differences, that could affect the web service's availability or configuration[2].\n\n- When automating tests, include validation for accessibility compliance (e.g., using axe-core or Lighthouse) during the account setup process to ensure the UI is usable for all users.\n\n- Capture and log all HTTP requests and responses during the account setup flow to help diagnose any discrepancies between Yarn and other package managers. This can be achieved by enabling network logging in Playwright or Cypress test runs.\n\n- If the website component supports batch operations or automated uploads (such as uploading user data or configuration files), verify that these automation features function identically after installation with Yarn[3].\n\n- For documentation, provide annotated screenshots or screen recordings of the account setup process, highlighting any Yarn-specific prompts, warnings, or differences encountered.\n\n- If the website component is not required, add a badge or prominent note in the README and installation guides stating \"No website or account setup required,\" and reference the test results confirming this.\n</info added on 2025-04-25T08:46:08.651Z>\n\n<info added on 2025-04-25T17:04:12.550Z>\nFor clarity, this task does not involve setting up a Yarn account. Yarn itself is just a package manager that doesn't require any account creation. The task is about testing whether any website component that is part of Taskmaster (if one exists) works correctly when Taskmaster is installed using Yarn as the package manager.\n\nTo be specific:\n- You don't need to create a Yarn account\n- Yarn is simply the tool used to install Taskmaster (`yarn add taskmaster` instead of `npm install taskmaster`)\n- The testing focuses on whether any web interfaces or account setup processes that are part of Taskmaster itself function correctly when the installation was done via Yarn\n- If Taskmaster includes a web dashboard or requires users to create accounts within the Taskmaster system, those features should be tested\n\nIf you're uncertain whether Taskmaster includes a website component at all, the first step would be to check the project documentation or perform an initial installation to determine if any web interface exists.\n</info added on 2025-04-25T17:04:12.550Z>\n\n<info added on 2025-04-25T17:19:03.256Z>\nWhen testing website account setup with Yarn after the codebase refactor, pay special attention to:\n\n- Verify that any environment-specific configuration files (like `.env` or config JSON files) are properly loaded when the application is installed via Yarn\n- Test the session management implementation to ensure user sessions persist correctly across page refreshes and browser restarts\n- Check that any database migrations or schema updates required for account setup execute properly when installed via Yarn\n- Validate that client-side form validation logic works consistently with server-side validation\n- Ensure that any WebSocket connections for real-time features initialize correctly after the refactor\n- Test account deletion and data export functionality to verify GDPR compliance remains intact\n- Document any changes to the authentication flow that resulted from the refactor and confirm they work identically with Yarn installation\n</info added on 2025-04-25T17:19:03.256Z>\n\n<info added on 2025-04-25T17:22:05.951Z>\nWhen testing website account setup with Yarn after the logging fix, implement these additional verification steps:\n\n1. Verify that all account-related actions are properly logged with the correct log levels (debug, info, warn, error) according to the updated logging framework\n2. Test the error handling paths specifically - force authentication failures and verify the logs contain sufficient diagnostic information\n3. Check that sensitive user information is properly redacted in logs according to privacy requirements\n4. Confirm that log rotation and persistence work correctly when high volumes of authentication attempts occur\n5. Validate that any custom logging middleware correctly captures HTTP request/response data for account operations\n6. Test that log aggregation tools (if used) can properly parse and display the account setup logs in their expected format\n7. Verify that performance metrics for account setup flows are correctly captured in logs for monitoring purposes\n8.

Measure and document time-to-completion for the account setup process to ensure it meets usability standards\n2. Create a satisfaction survey for test users to rate the account setup experience on a 1-5 scale\n3. Implement A/B testing for different account setup flows to identify the most user-friendly approach\n4. Add delightful micro-interactions or success animations that make the setup process feel rewarding\n5. Test the \"welcome\" or \"onboarding\" experience that follows successful account creation\n6.
