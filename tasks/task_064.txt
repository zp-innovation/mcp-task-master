# Task ID: 64
# Title: Add Yarn Support for Taskmaster Installation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement full support for installing and managing Taskmaster using Yarn package manager, ensuring users have the exact same experience as with npm or pnpm. The installation process, including any CLI prompts or web interfaces, must serve the exact same content and user experience regardless of whether npm, pnpm, or Yarn is used. The project uses 'module' as the package type, defines binaries 'task-master' and 'task-master-mcp', and its core logic resides in 'scripts/modules/'. The 'init' command (via scripts/init.js) creates the directory structure (.cursor/rules, scripts, tasks), copies templates (.env.example, .gitignore, rule files, dev.js), manages package.json merging, and sets up MCP config (.cursor/mcp.json). All dependencies are standard npm dependencies listed in package.json, and manual modifications are being removed. 

If the installation process includes a website component (such as for account setup or registration), ensure that any required website actions (e.g., creating an account, logging in, or configuring user settings) are clearly documented and tested for parity between Yarn and other package managers. If no website or account setup is required, confirm and document this explicitly.
# Details:
This task involves adding comprehensive Yarn support to the Taskmaster package to ensure it can be properly installed and managed using Yarn. Implementation should include:

1. Update package.json to ensure compatibility with Yarn installation methods, considering the 'module' package type and binary definitions
2. Verify all scripts and dependencies work correctly with Yarn
3. Add Yarn-specific configuration files (e.g., .yarnrc.yml if needed)
4. Update installation documentation to include Yarn installation instructions
5. Ensure all post-install scripts work correctly with Yarn
6. Verify that all CLI commands function properly when installed via Yarn
7. Ensure binaries `task-master` and `task-master-mcp` are properly linked
8. Test the `scripts/init.js` file with Yarn to verify it correctly:
   - Creates directory structure (`.cursor/rules`, `scripts`, `tasks`)
   - Copies templates (`.env.example`, `.gitignore`, rule files, `dev.js`)
   - Manages `package.json` merging
   - Sets up MCP config (`.cursor/mcp.json`)
9. Handle any Yarn-specific package resolution or hoisting issues
10. Test compatibility with different Yarn versions (classic and berry/v2+)
11. Ensure proper lockfile generation and management
12. Update any package manager detection logic in the codebase to recognize Yarn installations
13. Verify that core logic in `scripts/modules/` works correctly when installed via Yarn
14. If the installation process includes a website component, verify that any account setup or user registration flows work identically with Yarn as they do with npm or pnpm. If website actions are required, document the steps and ensure they are tested for parity. If not, confirm and document that no website or account setup is needed.

The implementation should maintain feature parity and identical user experience regardless of which package manager (npm, pnpm, or Yarn) is used to install Taskmaster.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify complete Yarn support through the following steps:

1. Fresh installation tests:
   - Install Taskmaster using `yarn add taskmaster` (global and local installations)
   - Verify installation completes without errors
   - Check that binaries `task-master` and `task-master-mcp` are properly linked
   - Test the `init` command to ensure it correctly sets up the directory structure and files as defined in scripts/init.js

2. Functionality tests:
   - Run all Taskmaster commands on a Yarn-installed version
   - Verify all features work identically to npm installations
   - Test with both Yarn v1 (classic) and Yarn v2+ (berry)
   - Verify proper handling of 'module' package type

3. Update/uninstall tests:
   - Test updating the package using Yarn commands
   - Verify clean uninstallation using Yarn

4. CI integration:
   - Add Yarn installation tests to CI pipeline
   - Test on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)

5. Documentation verification:
   - Ensure all documentation accurately reflects Yarn installation methods
   - Verify any Yarn-specific commands or configurations are properly documented

6. Edge cases:
   - Test installation in monorepo setups using Yarn workspaces
   - Verify compatibility with other Yarn-specific features (plug'n'play, zero-installs)

7. Structure Testing:
   - Verify that the core logic in `scripts/modules/` is accessible and functions correctly
   - Confirm that the `init` command properly creates all required directories and files as per scripts/init.js
   - Test package.json merging functionality
   - Verify MCP config setup

8. Website/Account Setup Testing:
   - If the installation process includes a website component, test the complete user flow including account setup, registration, or configuration steps. Ensure these work identically with Yarn as with npm. If no website or account setup is required, confirm and document this in the test results.
   - Document any website-specific steps that users need to complete during installation.

All tests should pass with the same results as when using npm, with identical user experience throughout the installation and usage process.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Update package.json for Yarn Compatibility [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the package.json file to ensure all dependencies, scripts, and configurations are compatible with Yarn's installation and resolution methods. Confirm that any scripts responsible for showing a website or prompt during install behave identically with Yarn and npm. Ensure compatibility with 'module' package type and correct binary definitions.

Since the request is vague, I'll provide helpful implementation details for testing website account setup with Yarn:

For thorough testing, create a test matrix covering different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux). Document specific Yarn-related environment variables that might affect website connectivity. Use tools like Playwright or Cypress to automate the account setup flow testing, capturing screenshots at each step for documentation. Implement network throttling tests to verify behavior under poor connectivity. Create a checklist of all UI elements that should be verified during the account setup process, including form validation, error messages, and success states. If no website component exists, explicitly document this in the project README and installation guides to prevent user confusion.

- For environments where the website component requires integration with external authentication providers (such as OAuth, SSO, or LDAP), ensure that these flows are tested specifically when Taskmaster is installed via Yarn. Validate that redirect URIs, token exchanges, and session persistence behave as expected across all supported browsers.

- If the website setup involves configuring application pools or web server settings (e.g., with IIS), document any Yarn-specific considerations, such as environment variable propagation or file permission differences, that could affect the web service's availability or configuration[2].

- When automating tests, include validation for accessibility compliance (e.g., using axe-core or Lighthouse) during the account setup process to ensure the UI is usable for all users.

- Capture and log all HTTP requests and responses during the account setup flow to help diagnose any discrepancies between Yarn and other package managers. This can be achieved by enabling network logging in Playwright or Cypress test runs.

- If the website component supports batch operations or automated uploads (such as uploading user data or configuration files), verify that these automation features function identically after installation with Yarn[3].

- For documentation, provide annotated screenshots or screen recordings of the account setup process, highlighting any Yarn-specific prompts, warnings, or differences encountered.

- If the website component is not required, add a badge or prominent note in the README and installation guides stating "No website or account setup required," and reference the test results confirming this.

For clarity, this task does not involve setting up a Yarn account. Yarn itself is just a package manager that doesn't require any account creation. The task is about testing whether any website component that is part of Taskmaster (if one exists) works correctly when Taskmaster is installed using Yarn as the package manager.

To be specific:
- You don't need to create a Yarn account
- Yarn is simply the tool used to install Taskmaster (`yarn add taskmaster` instead of `npm install taskmaster`)
- The testing focuses on whether any web interfaces or account setup processes that are part of Taskmaster itself function correctly when the installation was done via Yarn
- If Taskmaster includes a web dashboard or requires users to create accounts within the Taskmaster system, those features should be tested

If you're uncertain whether Taskmaster includes a website component at all, the first step would be to check the project documentation or perform an initial installation to determine if any web interface exists.

When testing website account setup with Yarn after the codebase refactor, pay special attention to:

- Verify that any environment-specific configuration files (like `.env` or config JSON files) are properly loaded when the application is installed via Yarn
- Test the session management implementation to ensure user sessions persist correctly across page refreshes and browser restarts
- Check that any database migrations or schema updates required for account setup execute properly when installed via Yarn
- Validate that client-side form validation logic works consistently with server-side validation
- Ensure that any WebSocket connections for real-time features initialize correctly after the refactor
- Test account deletion and data export functionality to verify GDPR compliance remains intact
- Document any changes to the authentication flow that resulted from the refactor and confirm they work identically with Yarn installation

When testing website account setup with Yarn after the logging fix, implement these additional verification steps:

1. Verify that all account-related actions are properly logged with the correct log levels (debug, info, warn, error) according to the updated logging framework
2. Test the error handling paths specifically - force authentication failures and verify the logs contain sufficient diagnostic information
3. Check that sensitive user information is properly redacted in logs according to privacy requirements
4. Confirm that log rotation and persistence work correctly when high volumes of authentication attempts occur
5. Validate that any custom logging middleware correctly captures HTTP request/response data for account operations
6. Test that log aggregation tools (if used) can properly parse and display the account setup logs in their expected format
7. Verify that performance metrics for account setup flows are correctly captured in logs for monitoring purposes
8. Document any Yarn-specific environment variables that affect the logging configuration for the website component

When testing website account setup with Yarn, consider implementing a positive user experience validation:

1. Measure and document time-to-completion for the account setup process to ensure it meets usability standards
2. Create a satisfaction survey for test users to rate the account setup experience on a 1-5 scale
3. Implement A/B testing for different account setup flows to identify the most user-friendly approach
4. Add delightful micro-interactions or success animations that make the setup process feel rewarding
5. Test the "welcome" or "onboarding" experience that follows successful account creation
6. Ensure helpful tooltips and contextual help are displayed at appropriate moments during setup
7. Verify that error messages are friendly, clear, and provide actionable guidance rather than technical jargon
8. Test the account recovery flow to ensure users have a smooth experience if they forget credentials
