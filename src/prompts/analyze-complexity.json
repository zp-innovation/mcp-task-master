Use the Glob tool to explore the project structure and understand the codebase size\n2. Use the Grep tool to search for existing implementations related to each task\n3. Use the Read tool to examine key files that would be affected by these tasks\n4. Understand the current implementation state, patterns used, and technical debt\n\nBased on your codebase analysis:\n- Assess complexity based on ACTUAL code that needs to be modified/created\n- Consider existing abstractions and patterns that could simplify implementation\n- Identify tasks that require refactoring vs. greenfield development\n- Factor in dependencies between existing code and new features\n- Provide more accurate subtask recommendations based on real code structure\n\nProject Root: {{projectRoot}}\n\n{{/if}}Analyze the following tasks to determine their complexity (1-10 scale) and recommend the number of subtasks for expansion.
