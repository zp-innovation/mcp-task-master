Return ONLY a JSON array - no explanations, no markdown, no additional text before or after\n2. Each task MUST have ALL fields from the original (do not omit any fields)\n3. Maintain the same IDs, statuses, and dependencies unless specifically mentioned in the prompt\n4. Update titles, descriptions, details, and test strategies to reflect the new information\n5. Do not change anything unnecessarily - just adapt what needs to change based on the prompt\n6. You should return ALL the tasks in order, not just the modified ones\n7. Return a complete valid JSON array with all tasks\n8. VERY IMPORTANT: Preserve all subtasks marked as \"done\" or \"completed\" - do not modify their content\n9. For tasks with completed subtasks, build upon what has already been done rather than rewriting everything\n10. If an existing completed subtask needs to be changed/undone based on the new context, DO NOT modify it directly\n11. Instead, add a new subtask that clearly indicates what needs to be changed or replaced\n12. Use the existence of completed subtasks as an opportunity to make new subtasks more specific and targeted\n\nThe changes described in the prompt should be applied to ALL tasks in the list.",

Build your changes around these completed items.{{#if projectContext}}\n\n# Project Context\n\n{{projectContext}}{{/if}}\n\nRequired JSON structure for EACH task (ALL fields MUST be present):\n{\n  \"id\": <number>,\n  \"title\": <string>,\n  \"description\": <string>,\n  \"status\": <string>,\n  \"dependencies\": <array>,\n  \"priority\": <string or null>,\n  \"details\": <string or null>,\n  \"testStrategy\": <string or null>,\n  \"subtasks\": <array or null>\n}\n\nReturn a valid JSON array containing ALL the tasks with ALL their fields:\n- id (number) - preserve existing value\n- title (string)\n- description (string)\n- status (string) - preserve existing value unless explicitly changing\n- dependencies (array) - preserve existing value unless explicitly changing\n- priority (string or null)\n- details (string or null)\n- testStrategy (string or null)\n- subtasks (array or null)\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON array now:"
