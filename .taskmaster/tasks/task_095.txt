# Task ID: 95
# Title: Implement .taskmaster Directory Structure
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 4, 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Consolidate all Task Master-managed files in user projects into a clean, centralized .taskmaster/ directory structure to improve organization and keep user project directories clean, based on GitHub issue #275.
# Details:
This task involves restructuring how Task Master organizes files within user projects to improve maintainability and keep project directories clean:

1. Create a new `.taskmaster/` directory structure in user projects:
   - Move task files from `tasks/` to `.taskmaster/tasks/`
   - Move PRD files from `scripts/` to `.taskmaster/docs/`
   - Move analysis reports to `.taskmaster/reports/`
   - Move configuration from `.taskmasterconfig` to `.taskmaster/config.json`
   - Create `.taskmaster/templates/` for user templates

2. Update all Task Master code that creates/reads user files:
   - Modify task file generation to use `.taskmaster/tasks/`
   - Update PRD file handling to use `.taskmaster/docs/`
   - Adjust report generation to save to `.taskmaster/reports/`
   - Update configuration loading to look for `.taskmaster/config.json`
   - Modify any path resolution logic in Task Master's codebase

3. Ensure backward compatibility during migration:
   - Implement path fallback logic that checks both old and new locations
   - Add deprecation warnings when old paths are detected
   - Create a migration command to help users transition to the new structure
   - Preserve existing user data during migration

4. Update the project initialization process:
   - Modify the init command to create the new `.taskmaster/` directory structure
   - Update default file creation to use new paths

5. Benefits of the new structure:
   - Keeps user project directories clean and organized
   - Clearly separates Task Master files from user project files
   - Makes it easier to add Task Master to .gitignore if desired
   - Provides logical grouping of different file types

6. Test thoroughly to ensure all functionality works with the new structure:
   - Verify all Task Master commands work with the new paths
   - Ensure backward compatibility functions correctly
   - Test migration process preserves all user data

7. Update documentation:
   - Update README.md to reflect the new user file structure
   - Add migration guide for existing users
   - Document the benefits of the cleaner organization

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create unit tests for path resolution that verify both new and old paths work
   - Test configuration loading with both `.taskmasterconfig` and `.taskmaster/config.json`
   - Verify the migration command correctly moves files and preserves content
   - Test file creation in all new subdirectories

2. Integration Testing:
   - Run all existing integration tests with the new directory structure
   - Verify that all Task Master commands function correctly with new paths
   - Test backward compatibility by running commands with old file structure

3. Migration Testing:
   - Test the migration process on sample projects with existing tasks and files
   - Verify all tasks, PRDs, reports, and configurations are correctly moved
   - Ensure no data loss occurs during migration
   - Test migration with partial existing structures (e.g., only tasks/ exists)

4. User Workflow Testing:
   - Test complete workflows: init → create tasks → generate reports → update PRDs
   - Verify all generated files go to correct locations in `.taskmaster/`
   - Test that user project directories remain clean

5. Manual Testing:
   - Perform end-to-end testing with the new structure
   - Create, update, and delete tasks using the new structure
   - Generate reports and verify they're saved to `.taskmaster/reports/`

6. Documentation Verification:
   - Review all documentation to ensure it accurately reflects the new user file structure
   - Verify the migration guide provides clear instructions

7. Regression Testing:
   - Run the full test suite to ensure no regressions were introduced
   - Verify existing user projects continue to work during transition period

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create .taskmaster directory structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the new .taskmaster directory and move existing files to their new locations
### Details:
Create a new .taskmaster/ directory in the project root. Move the tasks/ directory to .taskmaster/tasks/. Move the scripts/ directory to .taskmaster/scripts/. Move the .taskmasterconfig file to .taskmaster/config.json. Ensure proper file permissions are maintained during the move.
<info added on 2025-05-29T15:03:56.912Z>
Create the new .taskmaster/ directory structure in user projects with subdirectories for tasks/, docs/, reports/, and templates/. Move the existing .taskmasterconfig file to .taskmaster/config.json. Since this project is also a Task Master user, move this project's current user files (tasks.json, PRD files, etc.) to the new .taskmaster/ structure to test the implementation. This subtask focuses on user project directory structure, not Task Master source code relocation.

## 2. Update Task Master code for new user file paths [done]
### Dependencies: 95.1
### Description: Modify all Task Master code that creates or reads user project files to use the new .taskmaster structure
### Details:
Update Task Master's file handling code to use the new paths: tasks in .taskmaster/tasks/, PRD files in .taskmaster/docs/, reports in .taskmaster/reports/, and config in .taskmaster/config.json. Modify path resolution logic throughout the Task Master codebase to reference the new user file locations.

## 3. Update task file generation system [done]
### Dependencies: 95.1
### Description: Modify the task file generation system to use the new directory structure
